# Automation-of-Remote-Device-Configuration-File-Management-in-the-Laboratory
Skripsi project


This project requires an FTP server and a MySQL server.

Within the FTP server, create a subdirectory named default_config/ to store configuration files. The full path should be structured as FTP_default/default_config/.

To run the script, execute main.py for simplified menu or instead you could run Skripsi.py direct execution.
